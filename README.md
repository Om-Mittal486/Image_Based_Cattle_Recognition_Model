# Image_Based_Cattle_Recognition_Model
SIH Project

Problem Statement
Manual Animal Type Classification (ATC) in dairy farming is prone to human error, fatigue, and bias, leading to inconsistent results. This affects the Rashtriya Gokul Mission and other breeding programs that depend on reliable animal evaluation.

We aim to automate ATC using AI + Computer Vision to analyze cattle & buffalo images and predict their breed, sex, age, height, and weight ‚Äî consistently and efficiently.

üéØ Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Upload an image of cattle/buffalo.
	‚Ä¢	Extract physical traits (breed, sex, age, height, weight).
	‚Ä¢	Generate standardized ATC scores.
	‚Ä¢	Provide integration hooks for Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA).

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
	‚Ä¢	Frontend/UI: (Prototype ‚Äì React/Flutter planned)
	‚Ä¢	Backend API: Python (Flask / FastAPI)
	‚Ä¢	AI/ML: TensorFlow + Keras, MobileNetV2 for transfer learning
	‚Ä¢	Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow
	‚Ä¢	Storage: CSV/JSON (future: PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
	‚Ä¢	Deployment: Google Colab (training) ‚Üí VS Code (local demo)
